## Domain-Specific Testing Strategies

### AI Agent System Testing

#### Agent Execution Testing
```php
// Comprehensive agent execution testing
class AgentExecutionTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase, WithFaker;
    
    public function test_agent_executes_research_query_successfully(): void
    {
        // Arrange
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        $agent = Agent::factory()->research()->create();
        $query = 'What are the latest developments in AI?';
        
        // Mock external API responses
        Http::fake([
            'openai.com/*' => Http::response([
                'choices' => [
                    ['message' => ['content' => 'AI research findings...']]
                ]
            ], 200),
        ]);
        
        // Act
        $execution = $this->actingAs($user)
            ->postJson(route('agents.execute'), [
                'agent_id' => $agent->id,
                'query' => $query,
            ]);
        
        // Assert
        $execution->assertStatus(200)
            ->assertJson([
                'status' => 'completed',
                'agent_id' => $agent->id,
            ]);
        
        $this->assertDatabaseHas('agent_executions', [
            'agent_id' => $agent->id,
            'user_id' => $user->id,
            'status' => 'completed',
            'query' => $query,
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Quality Assurance Testing Workflows

#### Test Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Comprehensive test coverage assessment with targets
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --coverage

# Coverage targets for quality assurance:
# - Unit tests: >90% coverage
# - Feature tests: >80% coverage  
# - Integration tests: Critical paths covered
# - Browser tests: Key user journeys covered
# - Performance tests: Load scenarios validated
```

#### AI-Assisted Test Quality Review
```bash
# Comprehensive test quality analysis
mcp__zen__testgen --confidence=high

# Test quality assessment focuses on:
# - Test case comprehensiveness and completeness
# - Edge case coverage and boundary testing
# - Error scenario testing and exception handling
# - Performance test adequacy and load scenarios
# - Test maintainability and code organization
# - Test data management and cleanup
```

#### Testing Quality Gate Definitions

**Pre-Commit Testing Gates**
Before code can be committed:
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Feature tests cover new functionality
- [ ] No reduction in test coverage
- [ ] Performance tests within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Security tests pass validation

**Pull Request Testing Gates**  
Before code can be merged:
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Coverage meets minimum thresholds
- [ ] Integration tests validate system behavior
- [ ] Browser tests confirm user experience
- [ ] Load tests verify performance requirements

**Release Testing Gates**
Before code can be deployed:
- [ ] Complete regression test suite passes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Security test suite shows no vulnerabilities
- [ ] Browser compatibility tests pass
- [ ] Load testing validates production readiness

## Browser & End-to-End Testing

### Laravel Playwright Integration (Recommended)

**Package**: `hyvor/laravel-playwright` - Advanced Laravel integration for Playwright testing

#### Installation and Setup
```bash
# Install Laravel Playwright integration
./vendor/bin/sail composer require --dev hyvor/laravel-playwright

# Install frontend Playwright packages
./vendor/bin/sail npm install --save-dev @hyvor/laravel-playwright @playwright/test

# Install Playwright browsers
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test npx playwright install --with-deps
```

#### Browser Testing Commands
```bash
# Essential Playwright Commands for Laravel Development
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test npx playwright test              # Run all tests
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test npx playwright test --ui         # Run tests with UI
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test npx playwright test --debug      # Debug mode
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test npx playwright show-report       # View HTML report

# Specific test execution
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test npx playwright test agent-execution.spec.ts
./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test npx playwright test --grep "real-time"
```

## Test Organization & Best Practices

### Test Structure & Organization
```php
// Organized test structure with shared utilities
abstract class ApplicationTestCase extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase, WithFaker;
    
    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();
        
        // Common test setup
        $this->withoutExceptionHandling();
        $this->seed();
    }
    
    protected function createUserWithKnowledge(int $documentCount = 5): User
    {
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        
        KnowledgeDocument::factory()
            ->for($user)
            ->count($documentCount)
            ->create();
        
        return $user;
    }
    
    protected function mockAIService(): void
    {
        Http::fake([
            'openai.com/*' => Http::response([
                'choices' => [
                    ['message' => ['content' => 'Mocked AI response']]
                ]
            ], 200),
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Continuous Testing Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/tests.yml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      mysql:
        image: mysql:8.0
        env:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
          MYSQL_DATABASE: testing
          
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: 8.2
          extensions: dom, curl, libxml, mbstring, zip
          coverage: xdebug
          
      - name: Run Tests
        run: php artisan test --coverage
```

## Test Coverage & Quality Metrics
```bash
# Testing commands for comprehensive coverage
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --coverage             # Generate coverage report
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --coverage --min=80   # Enforce minimum coverage
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --parallel            # Parallel test execution
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --profile             # Performance profiling
```

Always prioritize comprehensive test coverage, realistic test scenarios, and maintainable test code. Focus on testing user workflows and critical business logic.
